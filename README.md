# 🧪 Playground Lab

Welcome to the lab.

This is my chaotic little corner of the internet where I:
- Try ideas  
- Break things  
- Learn stuff  
- Ship tiny experiments  
- Abandon half of them responsibly™

If it works — great.  
If it explodes — also great.

## 🧱 Stack

This project is scaffolded for:

- ⚛️ React  
- ⚡ Vite  
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS  
- 🌼 DaisyUI  

Translation: it’s fast, pretty, and mildly dangerous.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone it. Enter the lab. Push buttons.

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

Or if you're one of *those* people:

```powershell
pnpm install
# or
yarn
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open whatever URL Vite prints in the terminal.

Usually something like:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🧠 What This Repo Is For

- UI experiments  
- Component ideas  
- Animation tests  
- API poking  
- State management chaos  
- “Wait what if…” moments  

Basically: structured nonsense.

## 🛑 Production Ready?

Absolutely not.

Unless it is.

Then yes.

## 🧪 Philosophy

> Build fast.  
> Break things.  
> Keep the fun.
